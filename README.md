## Description
A simple AES implementation written in C. It started out as a little workshop activity during Cyber-Trace's Cryptography path and growed into a well-maintained small project. The algorithm was tested using example vectors supplied in NIST FIPS 197. The program was memory checked using Valgrind.
**This program shouldn't be used in production environments. It should only be used for educational purposes.**
## TODO
- Use a union to better deal with word-oriented transformations.
- Implement AES-196 and AES-256 algorithms.
- Sophisticate the command line parser.
